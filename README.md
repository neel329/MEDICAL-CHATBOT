# MEDICAL-CHATBOT
The Medical Chatbot project aims to develop an intelligent software system that utilizes natural  language processing and artificial intelligence techniques to provide medical assistance and support  to users. The chatbot serves as a virtual assistant, allowing users to ask medical questions, seek  advice, and receive relevant information.


1.1 OVERVIEW
The Medical Chatbot project aims to develop a user-friendly and accessible software system 
that utilizes natural language processing and artificial intelligence techniques to provide 
medical assistance and support. It acts as a virtual assistant, offering prompt and accurate 
responses to user queries about symptoms, diseases, treatments, medications, and general 
healthcare guidelines.

1.2 SUMMARY OF THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY
The Medical Chatbot is a user-friendly software system that utilizes natural language 
processing and artificial intelligence techniques to provide accurate and personalized medical 
assistance. It allows users to ask medical questions, seek advice, and receive reliable 
information about symptoms, diseases, treatments, and general healthcare guidelines. The 
chatbot analyses user queries, matches them with a knowledge base, and delivers prompt 
responses, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health.

1.3 PROBLEM STATEM
India faces challenges in providing quality and affordable healthcare services to its growing 
population. Issues such as lack of transportation, limited availability of doctors, and inadequate 
hospitality facilities hinder the provision of timely and efficient healthcare. This leads to 
delayed treatments, increased mortality rates, and overall healthcare system strain, as 
evidenced during critical situations like the COVID-19 pandemic

AIM 

The aim of the project is to develop a Conversational Chatbot for Medical Diagnostics that can 
bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. The chatbot will provide immediate 
responses to user queries, helping them access reliable medical information and assistance in a 
timely manner.

 METHODOLOGY
The methodology for developing the medical chatbot system involves several key steps. 
Initially, a diverse dataset of medical questions, answers, and relevant medical texts is collected 
and curated to ensure accuracy and relevance. The collected data is then preprocessed, 
involving cleaning and standardization to remove irrelevant information and enhance text 
understanding through techniques like tokenization and stemming. Next a range of natural 
language processing (NLP) techniques is applied. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is used to 
identify medical terms and symptoms within user queries, while Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging 
helps in understanding the grammatical structure. Syntactic parsing is performed to analyze the 
relationships between words, focusing on identifying the main verbal relations. To facilitate 
question-answering, a system is developed to match user queries with relevant answers from 
the dataset.
